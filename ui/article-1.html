                Hi I am Kiran Lanka. This is my first article which lets you know about me.

            <p>
                I am an engineer in ECE discipline from a local college. After my B.tech I was placed in Cognizant as sharepoint developer. I cleared IBPS exam which I had given during the college and got placed in Oriental bank of commerce which is PSU bank. So with lot of gyan from elders and parents about govt. job its benefits and career progression I left IT job n became Banker.

                Though I'm in govt. job, I feel I'm missing something, I often feel bored of the routine things that I do. So i tried finding solace by developing excel utilities to make my work simpler as well as enjoying. I really miss coding that's why I'm here on IMAD!!
